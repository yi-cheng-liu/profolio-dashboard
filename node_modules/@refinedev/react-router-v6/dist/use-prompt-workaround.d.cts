/**
 * `useBlocker` and `usePrompt` is no longer part of react-router-dom for the routers other than `DataRouter`.
 *
 * The previous workaround (<v6.4) was to use `block` function in `UNSAFE_NavigationContext` which is now removed.
 *
 * We're using a workaround from the gist https://gist.github.com/MarksCode/64e438c82b0b2a1161e01c88ca0d0355 with some modifications
 * Thanks to @MarksCode(https://github.com/MarksCode) for the workaround.
